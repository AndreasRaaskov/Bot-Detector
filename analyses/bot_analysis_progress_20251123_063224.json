      "reasoning": "High follower count with low following ratio (0.066), diverse & contextual post content showing personal opinions, humor, and topical engagement. Consistent identity markers (political strategist, feminist) align with profile claims. Low repost rate & original content percentage suggest authentic interaction patterns."

      "assessment": "human",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "High follower ratio and repetitive content red flags are offset by varied conversational tone, personal anecdotes, and informal language/typos in posts. Professional bio context also supports human authenticity."
    },
    "prompt3": {
      "assessment": "human",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "Profile shows specific personal details (book project, past roles, bylines), reasonable follower ratio, and organic conversational patterns in posts. Low bot-like activity (0% reposts, 90% replies). Some repetitive phrasing noted but within normal human variation."
    },
    "prompt4": {
      "assessment": "human",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "The profile description has professional coherence with specific credentials and timeline (book due 2026, former roles). Recent posts show human-like inconsistencies: typos ('through' instead of 'threw'), contextual errors ('fire' instead of 'fyre'), varied engagement styles (sarcasm, clarification, personal confusion), and topic diversity (food, news reactions, inside jokes). The follower ratio and activity metrics align with authentic human behavior."

      "confidence": 90,
      "reasoning": "The profile displays human-like nuances: varied emotional expressions, cultural references, personal anecdotes, and political commentary. Follower ratio (0.59) and engagement patterns (9% replies, 1% reposts) suggest organic interaction. Post content shows contextual humor, sarcasm ('Menopause Revenge Tour'), and topical responses to media ('Stephen King ruined pickles'). Low repost rate and high originality indicate authentic voice."
    },

      "assessment": "human",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "The account shows strong human indicators: varied tone covering personal stories, cultural references, and humor; consistent typos/informal language ('OMG', 'rn'); emotional expressions ('\ud83e\udd23', '\ud83e\udd2e'). While the high follower ratio and promotional language in one post are red flags, the lack of repetitive content and inhuman frequency (given context) are outweighed by authentic human markers like personal experiences ('text to my mother') and inconsistent formatting."

      "assessment": "ai_bot",
      "confidence": 85,
      "reasoning": "The profile exhibits multiple suspicious patterns: 1) The description contains disjointed phrases and non-sequiturs ('your rule of thumb is worrisome', 'IDIC', political Spanish phrase). 2) Recent posts show excessive exclamation points usage and performative enthusiasm. 3) High follower count with low following ratio suggests inorganic growth. 4) 0% original posts in activity distribution. 5) Posts contain non-contextual references (Epstein petition, Coast Guard/Cracker Barrel) with emoji clusters. 6) Unnatural phrasing like 'spiderly Thing' and 'Menopause Revenge Tour'."
    },
    "prompt4": {
      "assessment": "human",
      "confidence": 90,
      "reasoning": "The text contains idiosyncratic expressions, cultural references (IDIC, Chinga la migra), personal anecdotes, and emotional language that align with human communication patterns. The mix of topics, informal tone, and occasional typos ('ex's contact photo') suggest organic human expression rather than AI-generated content."

While the follower ratio is slightly elevated and posting patterns are unusual (100% replies), the raw emotional tone and contextual responses to unseen conversations suggest human operation. The lack of reposts/originals is atypical but consistent with a reply-focused human account."

The following/follower ratio is balanced (0.76) and posting frequency isn't specified as excessive. While highly political and repetitive in themes, the linguistic diversity suggests human authorship."

      "reasoning": "Profile exhibits multiple bot indicators: high follower count with low engagement ratio, unusual topic shifts in recent posts (conspiracies to sexual humor to politics), inflammatory language targeting specific groups, and overly explanatory description with awkward phrasing ('Boomer still trying to raise myself'). Lack of reposts/originals coupled with combative tone suggests engagement farming."

The sarcasm is organic and references contemporary events naturally without AI's typical neutrality."

      "reasoning": "High following/follower ratio (2.36) suggests artificial inflation. Recent posts are entirely empty, indicating potential scraping or placeholder behavior. Zero reposts and originals in sample, with only 10% replies, points to non-organic engagement. Presence of promotional links aligns with common bot behavior."

Replies make up 100% of recent activity (but data shows 10% replies, 0% reposts, 0% originals - calculation discrepancy noted).
